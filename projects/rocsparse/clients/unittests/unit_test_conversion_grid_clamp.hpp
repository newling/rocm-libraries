// Test-only helper for the conversion-directory grid tests
// (AISPARSE-684/685/686).
//
// The launches hardened by those tickets clamp grid.x against
// handle->properties.maxGridSize[0] and grid-stride over whatever the clamp
// drops. Reaching that clamp for real needs more than 2^32 - 1 work-items, e.g.
// 2^27 CSR rows (684) or 2^32 elements (685, 686), so the tests shrink the limit instead
// and run a small problem through the same code path. This is the AISPARSE-702
// idiom.
//
// A new leaf header rather than an addition to unit_test_utils.hpp: that file is
// shared with every sibling unit-test branch, and a new file cannot conflict
// with them. The sibling AISPARSE-699/700 branch adds an equivalent
// unit_test_grid_clamp.hpp; this one is deliberately named differently so the
// two branches do not collide on an add/add. Whichever merges second should
// delete its copy and include the other.
//

// Internal handle definition: the complete _rocsparse_handle type is required to
// reach handle->properties.
#include "rocsparse_handle.hpp"
