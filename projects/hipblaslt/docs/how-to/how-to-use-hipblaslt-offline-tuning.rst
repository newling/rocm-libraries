********************************
Using hipBLASLt offline tuning
********************************

``hipblaslt-bench`` can help find the best-performing GEMM kernel for a given set of GEMM problems
and provide the best solution index for a given problem size.
This index can be used directly in future GEMM calls through the User Offline Tuning mechanism.
However, these indices cannot be reused across library releases or across different device architectures.

Use the command line interface to access this functionality. See :ref:`clients` for more details.

Using hipblaslt-bench to run the tuning with the best GEMM kernel
=================================================================

To find and use the best GEMM kernel for a problem, follow these steps:

#. Generate the tuning command line by setting the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32`` before calling any hipBLASLt APIs. For more details on how to use ``hipblaslt-bench``, see :ref:`Logging and heuristics <logging-heuristics>`.
   In the Bash shell, set the following environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32

#. The following command uses `sample_hipblaslt_gemm.cpp <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/develop/projects/hipblaslt/clients/samples/01_hipblaslt_gemm/sample_hipblaslt_gemm.cpp>`_ as an example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./sample_hipblaslt_gemm

   The tuning command displays the following log entry:

   .. code-block:: bash

      hipblaslt-bench --api_method c -m 1024 -n 512 -k 1024 --lda 1024 --ldb 1024 --ldc 1024 --ldd 1024  --stride_a 0 --stride_b 0 --stride_c 0 --stride_d 0  --alpha 1.000000 --beta 1.000000 --transA N --transB N --batch_count 1  --a_type f16_r --b_type f16_r --c_type f16_r --d_type f16_r --scale_type f32_r --bias_type f32_r   --compute_type f32_r --algo_method index --solution_index 56073

#. Set the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE=<file_name>`` to tune and store the tuning result, which indicates the best solution
   indices for the GEMM problems. The ``<file_name>`` points to the tuning file.

   In the Bash shell, set the following environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE=tuning.txt

   Additionally, you can set the environment variable to specify that the solution found in the tuning stage is under the constraint of the max workspace size setting:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_USER_MAX_WORKSPACE=<value> (Default value is: 128 * 1024 * 1024)

   The default settings for the following parameters in ``hipblaslt-bench`` are changed in the tuning environment.

   .. code-block:: bash

      --iters |-i <value>             (Default value is: 1000)
      --cold_iters |-j <value>        (Default value is: 1000)
      --requested_solution <value>    (Default value is: -1)
      --rotating <value>              (Default value is: 512)

   After the tuning completes, the expected output is displayed as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./hipblaslt-bench --api_method c -m 1024 -n 512 -k 1024 --lda 1024 --ldb 1024 --ldc 1024 --ldd 1024  --stride_a 0 --stride_b 0 --stride_c 0 --stride_d 0  --alpha 1.000000 --beta 1.000000 --transA N --transB N --batch_count 1  --a_type f16_r --b_type f16_r --c_type f16_r --d_type f16_r --scale_type f32_r --bias_type f32_r   --compute_type f32_r --algo_method index --solution_index 56073

#. Set the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE=<file_name>`` to load the tuning file and override
   the default kernel selection with the optimal kernel choices, where ``<file_name>`` points to the tuning file.

   In the Bash shell, set the following environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE=tuning.txt

   For example, you can use ``hipblaslt-bench`` with ``algo_method`` set to ``heuristic`` to obtain the solutions for a problem,
   which include the best tuning solution index.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./hipblaslt-bench --api_method c -m 1024 -n 512 -k 1024 --lda 1024 --ldb 1024 --ldc 1024 --ldd 1024  --stride_a 0 --stride_b 0 --stride_c 0 --stride_d 0  --alpha 1.000000 --beta 1.000000 --transA N --transB N --batch_count 1  --a_type f16_r --b_type f16_r --c_type f16_r --d_type f16_r --scale_type f32_r --bias_type f32_r   --compute_type f32_r --algo_method heuristic --requested_solution 1 --print_kernel_info

How tuned entries are validated
===============================

A tuning file records ``kernel_name`` and ``solution_name`` next to each ``solution_index``. When the
file is replayed, the index is treated as a lookup hint: hipBLASLt resolves it in the current library
and uses it only if both names still match. The kernel name identifies the compiled kernel, while the
solution name also covers launch-shaping defaults such as GSU and WGM. A mismatch rejects the entry
and falls back to normal heuristic selection.

Validation is per entry, so upgrading hipBLASLt thins a tuning file rather than discarding it, and
only the shapes that failed need re-tuning. Files written by an older hipBLASLt may carry only one of
those names, which is validated against the corresponding current value, and files older still carry
no name at all; those last are used only when the file was produced by the running build.

Runtime tuning
==============

Instead of tuning offline with ``hipblaslt-bench``, hipBLASLt can benchmark candidate kernels itself
the first time it sees a GEMM shape and remember the winner.

Runtime tuning is a build-time opt-in and is **not compiled into a default build**. It requires:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_TUNING_CACHE=ON ...

Without that option none of the benchmarking, cache writing, or lifecycle reporting described below
is present in the library, and the two environment variables have no effect. The offline
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE`` path is unaffected either way. In a build that has it, the feature
is still off until you ask for it, with two environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=<off|cache|tune>
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH=<file_name>

``tune`` benchmarks supported candidates for each shape it has not seen before, at that shape's first
matmul, and appends the winner to the cache file. ``cache`` only replays what the file already
contains, validating each entry as described above. ``off`` is the default and changes nothing.

The cache file uses the same header/value-row format as an offline tuning file, so a file produced by
one can be read by the other. Runtime-tuned rows include a schema version and use an expanded problem
key. Rows produced by the current ``hipblaslt-bench`` writer have no schema version and retain the
historical matching behavior: they distinguish transpose, shape and the principal datatypes, but not
leading dimensions, batch strides, epilogue details or device identity. Do not put offline-tuned
problems that differ only in one of those omitted fields in the same file.

``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH`` and ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE`` are mutually exclusive; set
only one.

Only one process at a time may write a given cache file. Tuning is serialised within a process, but
nothing coordinates separate processes, so the ranks of a multi-process job such as MPI would each
benchmark the same shapes and append to the same file unsynchronised. Tune once in a single-rank
warm-up run, then start the job with ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=cache``, which only reads:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH=tuning.txt
   HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=tune ./your_application          # one rank, once
   mpirun -n 8 env HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=cache ./your_application

A typical run writes the cache once and reuses it afterwards:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH=tuning.txt
   HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=tune ./your_application    # benchmark and record
   HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=cache ./your_application   # replay only

The fastest measured candidate wins outright, with no minimum improvement over the default choice,
matching how ``hipblaslt-bench`` selects. The benchmarking effort can be adjusted:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ALL_KERNELS=<0|1>            (Default value is: 1)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MAX_CANDIDATES=<value>       (Default value is: 128)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_COLD_ITERS=<value>           (Default value is: 1000)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_HOT_ITERS=<value>            (Default value is: 1000)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ROTATING_MB=<value>          (Default value is: 512)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FLUSH_ICACHE=<0|1>           (Default value is: 1)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE=<value>  (Default value is: 300000, five minutes)

Each candidate is measured the way ``hipblaslt-bench`` measures one: ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_COLD_ITERS``
untimed launches, then ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_HOT_ITERS`` launches timed as a single span and reported as
the per-launch mean. Every candidate gets the full measurement, so there is no cheap ranking round
that could discard the real winner before it has been timed properly.

Candidates are measured against rotating copies of the tensors, so that successive launches do not
read and write the same cache lines. Without this every candidate is timed with its inputs already
resident, which is not how a production GEMM runs and which measurably changes which kernel appears
fastest. ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ROTATING_MB`` is the memory the rotation may use, and 0 disables it.

Rotation is declined for problems whose buffer sizes cannot be established from the problem
description alone, such as broadcast inputs with a zero batch stride and swizzled ``A`` or ``B``.
Those shapes are still tuned, just with their inputs cache-resident. Very small problems rotate over
fewer blocks than the memory budget would allow, since each block costs setup work per candidate.

The instruction cache is invalidated between timed launches, the same way and with the same kernel
the bench client uses, so a candidate is not timed with its own code already resident. It costs
roughly 5% of tuning time and measurably improves agreement with ``hipblaslt-bench``.
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FLUSH_ICACHE=0`` turns it off. The per-flush cost is measured once per device and
subtracted, so the recorded time stays the GEMM time and remains comparable to entries tuned without
it.

Where a shape's leading kernels are separated by more than measurement noise, this is enough to make
tuning land on the same kernel run after run. Where they are within a couple of percent of each
other, the choice stays unstable and tuning may pick a kernel marginally slower than the heuristic
default; that is a property of the measurement, not of the cache, and ``hipblaslt-bench`` behaves the
same way on those shapes.

By default every kernel that can run the problem is measured, not just the ones the selection
heuristic ranks highest, because the fastest kernel is not always inside that ranked prefix. Setting
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ALL_KERNELS`` to 0 restricts the search to the top ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MAX_CANDIDATES``
ranked kernels instead, which is faster but can miss the best one.

Tuning one shape this thoroughly takes time. An exhaustive search over several hundred candidates
takes minutes, and it is paid once per shape in the first process that runs with ``tune``.
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE`` puts a wall-clock ceiling on one shape, covering enumeration
and setup as well as the timed measurements. It defaults to five minutes, so that a first matmul
cannot block a live application indefinitely, and 0 removes the ceiling entirely.

A search the ceiling cuts short still records its best candidate, marked incomplete. Candidates are
not measured in order of expected performance, so the best of a truncated prefix is usually not the
shape's best kernel. It is never worse than not tuning at all, though: default selection's own choice
is put at the front of the candidate list and is therefore always measured first, so the best of any
prefix is at least as fast as what the shape would have run untuned. Recording it means a shape too
large to finish gets some of the benefit immediately rather than none.

An incomplete entry is replayed like any other. What the marking buys is that tune mode revisits the
shape when a run comes along that can finish the search, and replaces the row, so a partial answer
never becomes permanent. To finish such a shape, raise or clear
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE`` and run it in tune mode again; as a rough guide a
2048x1024x2048 FP16 shape takes about 146 seconds on MI300X, and the cost grows with the problem.

Each row records the ceiling it was written under, and a shape is only benchmarked again when the
current ceiling beats it, with 0 beating every finite one. Re-running the same workload at the same
ceiling therefore costs nothing: the search would measure the same candidates and stop in the same
place, so it is not repeated and no second row is appended. Within a single process a shape is
benchmarked at most once in any case.

Use the ceiling to bound how long tuning may run, not as a way to tune faster; to tune faster, reduce
the candidate list or the iteration counts.

The ceiling is checked between candidates, since a batch of launches already submitted cannot be
recalled. One candidate may therefore overrun it by as much as its own measurement takes. A search
that measures every candidate is kept however long it took, because a complete search gives the right
answer regardless of its duration.

Runtime tuning is close to how ``hipblaslt-bench`` measures, but not identical, so the two can
disagree between kernels that are within noise of each other. Runtime tuning caps how many rotation
blocks it uses, leaves the scale vectors and a forward bias unrotated, and enumerates candidates
through a different Tensile entry point. Both flush the instruction cache. Runtime tuning always
times with HIP events; ``hipblaslt-bench`` does the same only with ``--use_gpu_timer`` and otherwise
uses a synchronized CPU timer. Treat ``hipblaslt-bench`` as the reference when a shape matters
enough to check by hand.

Benchmarking never writes to your buffers. Candidates run against memory the library allocates for
the purpose, and only the winner runs on the real output.

Reading the tuning output
-------------------------

Because the first call on a new shape can block for minutes, ``cache`` and ``tune`` mode report what
they are doing without needing any logging variable. A first ``tune`` run looks like this:

.. code-block:: none

   tuning-cache: mode=tune path=tuning.txt load=not-found loaded=0
   tuning-cache: tuning-start m=2048 n=1024 k=2048 batch=1 trans=TN types=f16_r/f16_r; this call will block until it finishes
   tuning-cache: tuning-done winner=247670 elapsed=145.7s persisted=yes
   tuning-cache: summary shapes=1 matched=1 fellback=0 tuned=1 invalidated=0

Replaying that cache prints only the first and last lines, since a cache hit says nothing per call:

.. code-block:: none

   tuning-cache: mode=cache path=tuning.txt load=ok loaded=1
   tuning-cache: summary shapes=1 matched=1 fellback=0 tuned=0 invalidated=0

The summary is how you confirm a deployed cache is actually being used. ``shapes`` counts distinct
problems the process looked up, not calls, so it stays comparable with ``loaded``. ``matched`` is how
many of them a cache entry served and ``fellback`` how many fell through to the default heuristic;
those are the shapes still worth tuning. ``tuned`` counts distinct shapes this run benchmarked,
whether or not their winners reached the file; ``persisted`` on each ``tuning-done`` line is what
tells you that. ``invalidated`` counts entries rejected because a rebuild
moved the kernel they named. The summary is written as the process exits normally, so a run that is
killed or aborts does not produce one, and it is left out entirely when a process loaded no entries
and looked nothing up.

The output is bounded. A shape that cannot be tuned reports its reason once rather than once per
call, and shapes are announced at most once each. A shape declined for one call can still be tuned
on a later one, and that tune is reported:

.. code-block:: none

   tuning-cache: tuning-skipped in-place C==D with nonzero beta cannot be measured without mutating its input; using default selection

``tuning-skipped`` means the tuner understood the problem and declined it, which is expected for
some shapes forever. ``tuning-fallback`` means an attempt failed and is worth investigating.

Setting ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL=4`` keeps all of the above, timestamps it like the rest of the library
log, and adds per-problem cache hit, miss and invalidation lines, the scratch and candidate setup,
a progress heartbeat every ten seconds during a long search, and the winner's measured time against
the baseline. At that level nothing is collapsed, so every attempt is reported. See
:ref:`environment-variables` for where each of these is written.

Limitations
-----------

* Tuning happens on the C API execution path. Callers of the C++ extension API can replay a cache but do not tune.
* Grouped GEMM, pointer-array batch, RocRoller and HIP graph capture are excluded from tuning.
* An uncached in-place problem where ``C`` and ``D`` alias and ``beta`` is nonzero runs with normal selection instead of being tuned. Repeated benchmark launches would otherwise overwrite and reuse C rather than measuring the caller's input.
* One process should write a given cache file at a time. Multi-process jobs should tune in a
  single-rank warm-up and then run in ``cache`` mode; see above.
* ``alpha``, ``beta`` and whether ``C`` and ``D`` alias are not part of the lookup key, so an entry tuned at one value of ``beta`` can serve a caller using another.
* Passing ``algo=nullptr`` to ``hipblasLtMatmul`` does not replay cached winners, and such a call is
  left out of the summary rather than counted as a shape the cache served. In ``tune`` mode the shape
  is still benchmarked, and that winner does run.
