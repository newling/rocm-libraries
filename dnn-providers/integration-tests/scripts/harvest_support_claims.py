"""Harvest unclaimed support from CI logs of the bundle integration tests.

RFC 0015: a run of hipdnn_integration_tests prints a SUPPORT CLAIM SUMMARY
block after its tests.  Its unclaimed_support list names graphs that reached
the depth their bundle requires on this arch, platform and engine but
that no support.json sidecar claims yet.  This script reads CI job logs,
extracts those blocks, and prints the claim cells to add; with --write it
adds them to the sidecars.

Log handling
------------
1. GitHub timestamps and ANSI colours are stripped.  Lines are split into
   streams by their CTest "N: " prefix; unprefixed lines form one more stream,
   which is where CTest reprints the output of a failed test.  The same
   block therefore often appears twice; identical blocks count once.
2. Within a stream, each block is paired with the gtest results printed
   before it.  A block with no "[==========] ... ran." line before it, JSON
   that does not parse, schema_version != 1, a mode other than enforcing or
   warning_only, an invalid run arch, platform or engine,
   counters_consistent != true, or a harness_defects count other than 0 is
   rejected whole.  Each log is listed with the arch/platform pairs and
   modes of its blocks.  A warning_only block is harvested like an
   enforcing one: both report the same results.
3. Each unclaimed_support entry becomes one cell per case: (bundle, case,
   arch, platform, engine).  "reached: verified" means the comparison ran,
   not that it passed, so a cell is kept only when its gtest printed an OK
   line in the same stream.  A cell whose gtest FAILED or was SKIPPED, or
   printed no OK line, is dropped.  So is a cell whose reached depth is
   below its required depth, or either depth is missing.

Runs
----
4. A run is one CI workflow run.  Each RUN argument is a run read from disk:
   a job log, or a directory of *.log job logs.  Each --run ID is a run
   fetched from GitHub with the gh CLI: the logs of its jobs whose name
   matches --jobs and that succeeded or failed.  With neither, the latest
   completed scheduled run of the develop nightly is fetched.  A log whose
   text appears in two runs is refused, so no run counts twice toward
   --min-runs.
5. A log with a rejected block contributes nothing, and the exit status is
   1.  A log with no block, and a matching job that neither succeeded nor
   failed, is listed under Missing: its engines are absent from the
   harvest.  A job that timed out, for one, ends before its block.  A cell
   is claimed when it is kept in at least --min-runs runs and dropped in
   none; a single drop anywhere vetoes it.
6. claim_failures and failed_in_use are listed for a human; they are never
   claims.

Writing
-------
7. With --arch and --platform, the claims for that arch/platform are added
   to the current sidecars of their bundles, and each sidecar that would
   change is named; --write writes them.  --write needs both, so one change
   covers one arch/platform.  Claims are only added: a sidecar becomes its
   old claims plus the new ones.
8. The sidecars must be up to date.  The tip of develop is fetched from
   GitHub with git, and a sidecar that lacks any claim its develop version
   has is refused: rebase onto develop first.
9. Nothing is written if a log was rejected or any sidecar is refused (see
   support_sidecar.py).  verify_support_claims.py checks the result.

Exit status: 0 on success, 1 if any log was rejected or a sidecar was
refused, 2 on a usage error or when a run or develop cannot be fetched.
